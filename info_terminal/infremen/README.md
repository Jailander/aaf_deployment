# Overview

The **Infremen** package contains a waypoint proposer for the **Info Terminal**.
The tries to establish the probabilities of people presence at the individual waypoints and times and use this information to navigate to these waypoints when people are likely to be present.

Every midnight, it processes the information about the interactions it achieved during the day and creates dynamic probabilistic models of people presence at the individual waypoints. 
These models are then used to create a *schedule* that determines at which waypoints and times the robot offers its *Info Terminal* service.

# Practical 
You can edit the schedule manually.

##Parameters

The  **collectionName** determines what name will be used when saving and retrieving interaction history from the *monngodb*.
The  **scheduleDirectory** determines the place to store text files with the schedules.

##Dynamically reconfigurable parameters

The **explorationRatio** determines the balance between exploration (trying to establish the probabilitic functions of people presence) and exploitation (trying to meet people to actually interact).
If the battery level drops below the **minimalBatteryLevel**, the robot will go and recharge itself.
The robot will not leave the waypoint if there was an interaction during the last **interationTimeout** seconds. 
The **taskDuration** determines how long the robot waits for an interaction. 
The **maxTaskNumber** sets how much *Info Terminal* tasks are maintained at the same time. Setting **maxTaskNumber** causes the *Infremen* to stop proposing tasks.
